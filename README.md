# ExpressJS Supabase API Starter

![ExpressJS Supabase API Starter Header Image](image.png)

A simple starter for an ExpressJS-based REST API that connects to a Supabase-backend.

This example uses a table called "languages" and provides with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) examples.

This starter should just help get you going quickly, but I highly recommend you follow the best practices outlined on the [ExpressJS website](https://expressjs.com).
## Installation & Usage

Install express-supabase-api-starter using npm or yarn and access on TCP port 3000. Logs will be written to ```/var/log/api.log```.
